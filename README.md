This project demonstrates the integration of an ESP8266 microcontroller with a Unity model using a REST API to create a real-time digital twin. The ESP8266 collects sensor data and sends it to the REST API, which is then fetched by the Unity application for monitoring and control. To set up, you'll need an ESP8266, Arduino IDE, Node.js, and Unity 3D. First, configure the ESP8266 with WiFi credentials and program it to send sensor data to the REST API. Then, set up a Node.js server with Express to handle the data. Finally, integrate the Unity model to fetch and visualize the data in real-time, allowing for dynamic interaction with the physical hardware. This setup enables seamless synchronization between the physical and digital worlds, providing an effective digital twin solution.
